Hello! My name is Addis Muchui Makumi, and I am a Computer Science graduate with a BSc from Machakos University. Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of my skills, projects, and accomplishments.

## About Me

I am passionate about software development, problem-solving, and creating efficient solutions. During my time at Machakos University, I studied a variety of topics such as data structures, algorithms, programming languages, and computer networks. I am always eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve my skills.

My main areas of expertise include:

- Programming languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, C++
- Web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js
- Backend development: Python (Flask, Django)
- Mobile development: Android (Java)
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase
- Version control: Git, GitHub
- Artificial Intelligence: Chatbots

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. **Intelligent Information Management System for School Transition**: Developed a web-based system to manage the transition of students from primary to secondary school. The system featured an intelligent algorithm to match students with schools based on their performance and preferences. The project was implemented using Python Flask for the backend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and a MySQL database for data storage. This project improved the efficiency of the school transition process and provided valuable insights into student performance trends.
2. **Lawyer Booking Mobile App**: Designed and developed a mobile application that allows clients to book lawyers for consultations and legal services. The app was built using Java for Android and integrated with Firebase for user authentication, real-time database, and storage. This application streamlines the process of finding and booking legal professionals, improving accessibility and convenience for clients.
3. **AI Chatbot**: Developed an AI-powered chatbot using Python and the Django web framework. The chatbot is capable of understanding user inputs and providing relevant information or executing tasks based on user requests. This chatbot enhances user experience and offers an intuitive way for users to interact with the system that it is integrated into.
